# Lexical-Analyzer

ABSTRACT:

A lexical analyzer is a software that breaks down a source code into a series of tokens, which are then used to build other parts of a program. The process of breaking down a string of characters into tokens is called lexical analysis, and it is often the first step in compiling or interpreting a program.

Applications:
1. Compiler design
2. Web page formatting
3. Naturla language processing
4. Data cleaning
5. compressing input
